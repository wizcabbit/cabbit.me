      <h2>vHeard</h2>
      <div class="proj-10-title"></div>
      <p>We want to help the people, the people who can not see, the people who lost their vision.</p>
      <p>An old artist without any sight told me that, the heard and touch are very sensitive for them. Their ears are their eyes, they explore the world using heard. That's why we implement vHeard.</p>
      <p>vHeard, transfer the vision into sound wave, giving another way to help people explore our world.</p>
      <span>They are normal people like us, but very good at hearing.</span>

      <h4>Theory</h4>
      <p>vHeard using two camera, gathering visions in front of our user, and transfer it into sound wave. It is two camera that the sound in left and right is little different.</p>
      <p>Maybe first time we hear the sound like noise, but if our user have used to it, they use it very smoothly.</p>
