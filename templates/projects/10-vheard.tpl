      <h2>vHeard</h2>
      <p>We want to help the people, the people who can not see, the people who lost their sight.</p>
      <p>An old artist without any sight told me that, the heard and touch is very sensitive for them. Their ears are their eyes, they recognise the world through heard. That's why we implement vHeard.</p>
      <p>vHeard, transfer the vision into sound wave, to give another way to help people can not see.</p>
      <span>They are the people like us, just have sensitive heard.</span>
