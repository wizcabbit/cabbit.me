  <h2>Who AM I?</h2>

  <p>Morning! I am Wang Zhi Yong, I have another nick name: wizcabbit. Wizcabbit means wizard-cat-rabbit, I am obsessed anything unknown, like the real wizard and curios cat, but rabbit? yeah, the rabbit come out by magician~</p>

  <p>In 2006, I joined <a href="//www.bjut.edu.cn">Beijing University of Technology</a>, and at same year, I joinned an organization of technology called Frontfree, and a startup company called <a href="//www.digihail.com">Digihail</a>. My university, Frontfree and Digihail, that all three trained me as a student, a tech leader and a engineer. I did many UI/UE project implements,  research on efficient and simple solutions from design to implementation, and lead teammates work comfortably and smoothly. </p>

  <p>In 2010, after gotten my master degree, I joined <a href="//www.ibm.com">IBM</a> as a IT consultant. Maybe IT consultant looks little different from engineer, but that experience trained my logic, critical thinking skills and tech me how to work in a large company -- it's different from working in a startup.</p>

  <p>Currently, I am working at <a href="//www.wanda.cn">Wanda Group</a>, focus on front-end solution and team. I am interested in anything unknown especially about web front-end. If you have anything cool, or any idea shinning, please feel free to contact me.</p>
